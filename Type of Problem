What type of problem are you solving??-->supervised or unsupervised or regression,etc

We need to see the big picture

We dont need to predict the churn rate.We need to reduce it.

Identify the customers who will leave

So now it seems like we have a supervised learning problem where we just need to classify whether the person will leave or not.

Now I can identify the amount with which they want to leave the platform and give the discount accordingly.

So,this seems to be like a regression problem.
